# landing-page

## About
I've created this landing page as a place for me to practice fundamental web
development. So far I've used my self  taught HTML and CSS to build the design of 
the page. Now I'm currently working on implementing javascript! With each commit I'm
sharpening my skills on how to create a meaningful and easy to understand log of my
progress for me and other to look back on if they wish to contribute.
